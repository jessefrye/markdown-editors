# Markdown Styling for OSX Apps

I wanted to evolve and save the styling for the markdown editors I use so I saved them here. There are typically two documents. One styles the editor and the other styles the rendered output. The latter is usually a CSS file. I made a icon (.icns) file for each which I think look better.

## MacDown [check it](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)

The location for the MacDown documents is `/Library/Application Support/MacDown`

## Write [check it](http://writeapp.net/mac/)

The location to change the styling for Write is under the File Menu: Write > Preferences. You usually have to restart for the changes to take place.

### Add your own Themes?

If you'd like to add another theme or another editor's themes just send a pull request.
